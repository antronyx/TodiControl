# Antronyx T.O.D.I. Control 

The program I wrote to control my first semi-humanoid robot.
Check it out on [@antronyx_robotics](http://www.instagram.com/antronyx_robotics).

This is a personal high school project.

This visual basic program act as a bridge, it takes data from an arduino-hacked PS1 controller and send it to the robot, visualizing data on screen.
